DevOps also plays a vital role in the Software Development Lifecycle: integrating development and testing with better efficiency and quality of software through operations. Better collaboration between teams, avoidance of bottlenecks in development software delivery through automation, Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipelines, and Infrastructure as Code. Security will also be introduced into DevOps to ensure that applications are safe and compliant from the outset. DevOps ensures faster releases and less time spent in overall system downtime since it is developed based on cloud technologies, monitoring tools, and test automation. That makes it of prime importance today in software development.
