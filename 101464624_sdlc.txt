DevOps is important in Software Development Lifecycle as it provides for the collaboration of teams and hence brings about quality and develops speed. In essence, DevOps integrates all stages of development, testing, and operation of the software through a continuous delivery approach using CI/CD Pipelines, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and Cloud Technologies. In addition, security has been deeply ingrained with the DevOps lifecycle from its outset to minimize risks and ensure better compliance. With DevOps, continuous automation and the close monitoring of software performance can be achieved by enabling quicker software releases, lesser software downtime, and more reliable applications.
