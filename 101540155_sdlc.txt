Learning DevOps is extremely important because it speeds up the software development process, increases reliability, and is easy to manage once you know what you're doing. It removes the delays between coding and deployment, which can help teams release updates far more quickly and efficiently than just doing it by themselves. Without DevOps, teams would have to rely on manual processes, which could lead to inconsistent deployments and difficulties in maintaining larger software systems.
